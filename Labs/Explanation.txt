The PRM algorithm was likely chosen because the navigation environment is static with known obstacle rectangles, and the configuration space is relatively low-dimensional (2D). 
PRM is well-suited for such scenarios as it can efficiently construct a roadmap of the free configuration space by sampling and connecting nodes, enabling multiple path planning queries within the same environment. 
Additionally, PRM's simplicity, ease of implementation, and potential for probabilistic completeness and resolution optimality make it a suitable choice for this static navigation task. 
While RRT may be more appropriate for dynamic environments, high-dimensional configuration spaces, or online path planning scenarios, the static and low-dimensional nature of the problem aligns better with the strengths of the PRM algorithm.
